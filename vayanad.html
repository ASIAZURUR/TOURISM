                                        Banasura Sagar Dam was built across the Karamanathodu River, a tributary of River Kabini. Ideally placed in the foothills of Banasura hills, it is the largest earthen dam in India and the second largest in Asia. The dam got its name from Banasura, the son of King Mahabali, the famous ruler of Kerala. It is said that Banasura undertook severe penance on the top of the hills. Banasura hill is the third largest peak in the Western Ghats.
                                        
                                        The dam was built in 1979 under the Indian Banasura Sagar Project that was started to support the Kakkayam Hydro Electric Power Project. This project also aimed at contributing to the drinking water and irrigation requirements of the locals during the hot summer season. Banasura Sagar Dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders. The reservoir is marked with a cluster of small islands which were formed when the reservoir submerged the surrounding areas during monsoon season. These islands with the background of the Banasura hill provide a mesmerizing sight to the tourists as part of Wayanad holiday packages.

The waterfall cascades down into a large pool, which is a good place for swimming and bathing. The water from Soochipara Falls later joins Chaliyar River after Vellarimala Hills near Cherambadi in Tamil Nadu. The waterfall got its name from a needle-shaped rock situated here where soochi means rock and para means needle. It is regarded as one of the prominent Wayanad tourist attractions.
                                        
                                        This waterfall, surrounded by dense green forest, is one of the best waterfalls in Wayanad. A 20-minute drive from Meppadi will take you to this splendid waterfall. Visitors have to trek down for about 2 km to reach the falls from the road point through the well-laid path. The trekking is of easy level, which takes about 30 minutes one way. There are high chances that visitors may get a glimpse of wildlife like Deer.
